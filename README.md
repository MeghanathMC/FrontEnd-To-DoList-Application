# Todo List Application

## Overview

This is a simple Todo List application built using React. It allows users to add, update, and complete tasks. The tasks can be searched and are displayed in an expandable list format.

## System Design

The application consists of the following components:
- **AddTask:** Handles adding new tasks.
- **Task:** Represents a single task.
- **TaskList:** Manages the list of tasks, including search functionality.

The tasks data is stored in a dummy JSON file and managed using React state.

## Implementation

- **Add Task:** Users can add a new task with a title and description.
- **Update Task:** Users can update the title and description of existing tasks.
- **Mark as Done:** Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Search Tasks:** Users can search tasks by title.
- **Expandable List:** Tasks are displayed in an expandable format, showing the description and last update timestamp when expanded.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd todo-list-app
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
